# Assured Timing Detector - Status Display (ATD-SD)
Version 1.0

The Assured Timing Detector (ATD) software provides an implementation in C++ of an adaptable, model-based system for monitoring a timing signal for anomalies versus a reference time source ensemble.

This software, the **Assured Timing Detector-Status Display**, is a companion to the ATD software system that allows for Web browser hosted monitoring of system health and annunciation of timing anomaly alerts.

This software was developed with funding from the Science and Technology Directorate of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
